Gnomy aims to provide an easy to use android app for personal finance tracking. Because open source apps don't need to be complicated :)

You can trust gnomy to help you organize your expenses and therefore guard your money. That's what gnomes do after all.

## Status
Currently under development. This section will tell you when alpha, beta and stable releases are ready.

## What's working?
- In-app account/wallet creation and edit
- Transactions creation (incomes, expenses and in-app transfers) and edit
- Monthly balance history for individual accounts
- Details screen for accounts
- Global monthly balance history
- Support to either archive (deactivate) or delete an account
- Monthly list of transactions
- Filtering of transactions list (supports custom end and start dates)
- Visualization of unresolved transactions (that haven't been confirmed by the user)
- Adaptive icons. The project's logo might change if someone has a better design.
- User-defined categories for transactions

## The roadmap to v1
- Support for multiple currencies accross the app
- Support for recurring transactions
- Dashboard screen -> (1ST ALPHA RELEASE BREAKPOINT)
- Charts!!
- Notifications (for transactions that are expected to happen today) -> (2ND ALPHA RELEASE BREAKPOINT)
- UI/UX enhancements
- Accessibility features
- Translations (I initially plan to support spanish and english, perhaps esperanto if it is even possible because I'm a nerd). Wanna help with that? :D
- Dark theme support
- Database encryption -> (1ST BETA RELEASE BREAKPOINT)
- Database import/export so that you can keep your data safe in the cloud (see previous bullet) -> (2ND BETA RELEASE BREAKPOINT)
- Trainer feature to help you achieve your financial goals -> (3RD BETA RELEASE BREAKPOINT)
- Search transactions by concept or notes -> (PRE-RELEASE BREAKPOINT)
- F-droid releases

## Nice-to-have features that might or might not get implemented some day
- Support for different types of accounts (for example, inversions). Right now, the app offers "types" but those are only informative, they do not have any effect on the app's behavior.
- Automatic transactions from real bank accounts (intercepting bank app android notifications)
- Cryptocurrencies support (I doubt that will happen, but who knows)
- Google play store releases

## Wanna help?
